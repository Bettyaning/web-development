            <h3>experience & progression in web development:</h3>
            <p>My experience thus far has been somewhat smooth yet challenging. Sometimes I feel like I am consistently hitting roadblocks when I am coding and get stressed out, but I’ve come to a realisation that HTML and CSS are very forgiving when it comes to mistakes. I’ve learnt the basic tags and elements needed to create a basic portfolio website and even a general website in the foreseeable future. I struggled when I first started this assignement with the debugging process but found alternatives such as opening with live server (which is so convenient when you want to code and look at your saved changes simultaneously!), some tags and elements such as input, grid layouts, and css tags such as align-items, padding, margin etc. I have become so used to that when im typing my code I do it unconsciously and the code comes out the way I want to! And this is due to the time ive put outside of uni (using Codecademy pro) and the help of my peers and lecturers to achieve this skill. However one of my current weaknesses in coding is constantly missing out small things in my syntax such as “, : and >
                I am sure I will be able to overcome this once I further my practise within the module.

                <h3>why & how?</h3>
                <p>
                I first started the assignment about 2 weeks prior to being introduced to the github subcourse within the web development module, I first started off with a basic grid layout – main, aside, footer, nav etc. but as the weeks progressed I didn’t like the idea of the aside so I removed it. At times I’d find myself starting from scratch which isn’t always the best idea but I felt that starting from scratch would sometimes be better than fixing a bunch of code (pulling my hairs out too!) but I found a solution, for instance my hamburger icon was not working with css, it wasn’t aligning to the header (where I placed my nav into since it was at the very top of the page) but it would never align to the left of my page with my logo image there, so I decided to move my hamburger menu to the right making it work, and it looked aesthetically pleasing than it did before.
                I decided to stick to the grey, white and pink theme since they are my top 3 colours and it aesthetically goes with my logo which I created myself using the wix logo maker. I also made the header, footer and nav grey whilst my background colour is an off-white with a few streaks of grey(my background is an image).This allows my website to give it a classy yet elegant finish.  I also chose the “Barlow, Sans-serif font via google fonts as I felt it best complimented the colour scheme for my website and the ultimate goal of the website which was to give it a nice, sleek look to it.
                My stream of inspirations came from https://www.pixpa.com/blog/design-portfolio
